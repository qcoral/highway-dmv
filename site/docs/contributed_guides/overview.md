# Guides

Welcome! This is a tab where Hack Clubbers (just like you!) can write tips n' tricks, guides, and pretty much any info on projects that they've previously built. 

The goal is to have a collection of resources that grows as highway goes on.

The first one is on how to make a Game Console - check it out on the sidebar!

#### Contributing

To contribute, make a markdown file in the app/views/guides folder! Put your guide in there.

Make sure to name your guide according to how you want it to appear on the website. Dashes and will be removed so use kebab case for spaces.

**In return, you'll get rewarded 1 free point for adding a *finished* guide**
