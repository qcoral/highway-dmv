# Designing for real life

tl;dr:

- Add 0.2mm tolerances on any 3D printed part that makes contact with something else - this is to account for any inaccuracies in your printer, the filament, etc
- Frequently think about how your parts are actually going to be manufactured and whether or not it's realistic - intricate patterns may often not show up as well depending on your manufacturing method (3D printing, CNC milling, etc)
